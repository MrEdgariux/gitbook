# Furry Review

### 2024-08-21 - Review Version 4 released!

Hello tiktokers! We're really happy to announce a new tiktok review update!

* Added a introduction (or INTRO for short) where you can know who's the review is.
* Added conclusions (or OUTRO for short) where you can have a look on points, status (like accepter, or rejected) and date of review. These cards will be improving soon!
* Improved point giving/taking systems.
* Now you can see all furries that were favourite at that time of the review (intro).

### 2024-10-26 - Review Version 4.1 comes in!

* We currently rolling out this and testing things, that means everything may change in the future.
* We added updated intro, where we introduce our favorite tiktokers.
* Also we added outro :)
* Updated review card, so from now on, you'll see new updated card.
* We also made a website where we put all review data for future stuff, like points, last reviewed file and results.
* Everything is being automated, so only review card is required and also rules to be entered manually :)
