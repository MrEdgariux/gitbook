# Main page

This is my reviewed content of furries. I mostly review only them, and not others so this is most popular one. So you can have all logs of what gave the furry a point and what took him a point or other information related with them :fox:

{% hint style="info" %}
Not all reviews might be there, because I am too tired to update this repo every time I finish review

### 2024-10-26 - Review Version 3.1 comes in!

* We currently rolling out this and testing things, that means everything may change in the future.
* We added updated intro, where we introduce our favorite tiktokers.
* Also we added outro :)
* Updated review card, so from now on, you'll see new updated card.
* We also made a website where we put all review data for future stuff, like points, last reviewed file and results.
* Everything is being automated, so only review card is required and also rules to be entered manually :)
