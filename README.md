# Main page

Welcome to the project called "TikTok Reviews". Where I (yes, I) review random tiktok videos, by rating them.

Currently we only review "Furry TikTok Content" so this is only the thing I have to review.

Also we are building a website where you will be able to see the review statuses, all furries I have in queue and more.

This is my reviewed content of furries. I mostly review only them, and not others so this is most popular one. So you can have all logs of what gave the furry a point and what took him a point or other information related with them :fox:

{% hint style="info" %}
I will try my best to fit all furries that was reviewed in version 4.1
{% endhint %}
