# Fox Tomas

## Review Part 1

The first review didn't had any image whatsoever, it was just first version of review. Basic with comments in it.

## Review Part 2

Same, was second review without any image, and it was basic anyways with comments in the video.

## Review Part 3

This is where we started reviewing furries, so ye, I also reviewed him. But card was made for Part 4 so... No image card there as well xD

{% hint style="warning" %}
Because he has a lot of parts of reviews, I had to make decisions on waiting for a line as there more to review, not only him, so I believe we will create Review Part 6 at 2025th.
